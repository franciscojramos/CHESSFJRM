##Chess Board Application

This project is an electronic chessboard application developed as part of the Object Oriented Programming course at the University of Piraeus in Athens, Greece. 
The project was completed during my Erasmus exchange program in 2024.
The application features a basic windowed chessboard where two players can play a game of chess. 
While the primary focus is on the visual representation of the chessboard, I added functionality to validate the legal movements of each piece as a bonus feature.
